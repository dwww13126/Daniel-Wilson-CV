  <div class="text-box" id="bio-textbox">
    <p class="hidden">After having gained many years experience working on and with computer
      systems from completing my computer science degree and personal endeavors, Working in
      the IT technical support field would provide me the opportunity to apply the skills I
      have learnt to help support operations within the workplace. </p>
    <p class="hidden">I am a well motivated worker who always strives to complete the work I
       am given to the highest standard through treating every task I work on as a new
       opportunity to improve my skill set. This determination in continuing to learn
       has been reflected by my grades continually improving throughout the 28 papers
       I have completed within the area of Computer Science leading to an A grade average
       and being awarded a CMS Prize for Excellence at 300 level in 2021 during my last
       year of study.</p>
    <p class="hidden">Studying Computer Science at Waikato University has provided me
      with a lot of skills and experience when it comes to working with a wide range
      of computer programs and systems both in completing projects using technologies
      taught to us and becoming familiar with setting up database and webserver systems.</p>

  <div class="text-box"><h3>Software Troubleshooting / Hardware Upgrades:</h3></div>
  <div class="text-box">
    <p>Over the last 6 years, a hobby I have worked on myself was the purchasing of
      electronic goods such as laptops, desktops and mobile phones online for means
      of fixing, upgrading and reselling. This has given me an extensive amount of
      experience in troubleshooting and solving hardware and software issues on Mac,
      Windows, IPhone and Android devices. During this time I have picked up on a
      vast amount of solutions for commonly faced hardware and software issues which
      I have regularly come across, this knowledge has lead to me having a fairly
      easy time diagnosing problems similar to what I have encountered and using this
      to decide what would be the best way to go about trying to solve the issue. </p>
      <p>When it comes to working on computer hardware, I am competent in performing
        upgrades and repairs on computers as I have extensive experience in disassembling
        laptop and desktop systems during my time of fixing and repairing devices for
        online sales. I make sure to thoroughly check that systems are performing as
        intended before treating the job as completed.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-box"><h3>Easily Approachable:</h3></div>
  <div class="text-box">
    <p>Having previously worked as a student representative in 2021 for two
      of my Computer Science papers during my time studying, I know the
      importance of being a person who can attentively listen to other’s
      concerns while also responding in a friendly and easy to understand
      manner to discuss any ideas which others might have.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-box"><h3>Prompt Communication:</h3></div>
  <div class="text-box">
    <p>It has always been an utmost priority of mine with any situation of
      contact to maintain quick and hassle free communication with others,
      whether that be with group members when working on a university project
      or when dealing with customers during my time of conducting Trademe
      sales online. I have found prompt communication to be one of the key
      aspects of avoiding unnecessary frustration such as my experience with
      Trademe online sales where I have been able to maintain a 100% positive
      feedback rating over the course of 500 trades through providing regular
      updates to buyers of their order status and making quick replies to any
      queries that they might have.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-box"><h3>Quick To Learn and Adapt:</h3></div>
  <div class="text-box">
    <p>During studying at Waikato University the short amount of time given
      to us when being introduced to new software and skills has allowed me
      to become accustomed to quickly learning what is required in order to
      complete the tasks we are given in a timely manner. One of the most
      important steps to achieving this was by gaining a thorough understanding
      of the problem needing to be solved before planning what steps need to
      be taken in solving it.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-box"><h3>Working With Digital Media Software:</h3></div>
  <div class="text-box">
    <p>I have enjoyed working with Digital Audio Workstation software such
      as Logic Pro and Ableton Live to create electronic music. During my
      time studying at Waikato University I completed 4 digital music papers
      using these software utilities allowing me to minor in Music. </p>
    <p>I have made further use of my digital media skills by volunteering
      to help with audio / video and operating the live streaming setup at
      our local church to maintain operation throughout the disruptions
      caused by Covid-19.</p>
