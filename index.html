  <div class="text-box" id="bio-textbox">
    <p class="hidden">I have gained many years experience working on and with computer
      systems by completing my computer science degree and pursuing my own personal
      projects. Working in the IT technical support field would provide me with the
      opportunity to apply these skills in supporting operations within the workplace.</p>
    <p class="hidden">I am a well-motivated worker who always strives to complete what
      I am given to the highest standard, treating every task I work on as a new
      opportunity to improve my skill set. This determination has been reflected
      in the way my grades continually improved throughout the 28 Computer Science
      papers I completed at Waikato University. Graduating with an A-grade average,
      alongside the CMS Prize for Excellence in 2021.</p>

  <div class="text-box"><h3>Software Troubleshooting / Hardware Upgrades:</h3></div>
  <div class="text-box">
    <p>Over the last 6 years, I have made it a hobby to purchase electronic goods
      such as laptops, desktops and mobile phones; for means of fixing, upgrading
      and reselling. This has given me an extensive amount of experience in
      troubleshooting and solving hardware and software issues on Mac, Windows,
      IPhone and Android devices. During this time I have picked up a vast amount of
      solutions for commonly faced hardware and software issues which I have regularly
      come across. This knowledge has led to me having a fairly easy time diagnosing
      problems that are similar to what I have encountered, using this to decide
      what would be the best way to go about trying to solve the issue. </p>
    <p>When it comes to working on computer hardware, I am competent in
      performing upgrades and repairs on computers as I have experience
      disassembling laptop and desktop systems when  fixing and repairing
      devices for online sales. I make sure to thoroughly check that
      systems are performing as intended after completing repairs and
      upgrades, to ensure a reliable experience for the user of the device.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-box"><h3>Easily Approachable:</h3></div>
  <div class="text-box">
    <p>Having previously worked as a student representative in 2021 for two of
      my Computer Science papers and actively looking for ways in which I can
      help out other class members with tasks, I am a person who can
      attentively listen to others and respond in a friendly and easy to
      understand manner to discuss any ideas.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-box"><h3>Prompt Communication:</h3></div>
  <div class="text-box">
    <p>It has always been a priority of mine, with any situation requiring
      contact, to maintain quick and hassle free communication with others.
      I find maintaining good communication is a key aspect in avoiding
      unnecessary frustration. This has especially been true with my
      experience conducting Trademe online sales where I have been able
      to maintain a 100% positive feedback rating over the course of 500
      trades. I have achieved this through providing accurate descriptions
      for the items I sell, while making regular updates to buyers of their
      order status and replying promptly to any queries that customers might
      have.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-box"><h3>Quick To Learn and Adapt:</h3></div>
  <div class="text-box">
    <p>Studying Computer Science at Waikato University has provided me with
      a lot of skills and experience when it comes to working with a wide
      range of computer programs and systems, both in completing projects
      and setting up the systems using the skills taught to us. The short
      amount of time given to us when being introduced to new software and
      skills has allowed me to become accustomed to quickly learning what
      is required in order to complete the tasks we are given.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-box"><h3>Working With Digital Media Software:</h3></div>
  <div class="text-box">
    <p>As a personal hobby, I have enjoyed working with Digital Audio
      Workstation software such as Logic Pro and Ableton Live to create
      electronic music. During my time studying at Waikato University
      I completed 4 digital music papers using these programs, allowing
      me to minor in Music. I have made further use of my digital media
      skills by volunteering to help with audio / video and running the
      live streaming setup at our local church, in order to maintain operation
      throughout the disruptions caused by Covid-19.</p>
